# opkssh-renewer

This is a simple wrapper for [opkssh](https://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh) to renew certificates and (re-)add them to a running ssh-agent as required.

By default if the expect key/certificate is not found or is older than 23-hours it will be renewed by running "opkssh login".

## Process

1. Short lived SSH key/certificate generated by "opkssh" is checked for age (by default "~/.ssh/id_opkssh").
2. If this file is older than 23-hours the "opkssh login" process is started to generate a new identity to a temporary directory (by default "~/.ssh/opksshXXXXXX/")
3. Assuming this completes the resulting key/certificate are added to the "ssh-agent"
4. The old identity is removed from the "ssh-agent"
5. The new identity files are moved into place

## Requirements

As this process attempts to add the opkssh identity to the local "ssh-agent", the "OpenSSH Agent" Windows service must be set to "Manual" startup.

## Using with PuTTY

As PuTTY has it's own SSH agent implementatation (Pageant), you must use a bridge between the two protocols such as https://github.com/ndbeals/winssh-pageant.

This implementation will allow PuTTY to use keys added to the native Windows ssh-agent.
